Builder Design Pattern

1. Complex process to construct object involving multiple steps.
2. We remove complex steps of object creation and add it to some builder class.
3. Method chaining is not mandatory for this pattern.Only the director class(main.java) implementation will change. 
3. It is better to have inner class implementation as we dont have any setter method defined which make our class immutable.
4. Defining abstract class is optional if we dont have any futher implementation ,can use direct 
   concrete class for the same.
